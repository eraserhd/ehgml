ehgml README
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ehgml is Eraserhead GML, a GML interpreter/ray-tracer which was implemented
for the Third Annual ICFP programming contest.

Well, I didn't quite make the contest deadline (I submitted *something* tho ;-)
but I did have quite a bit of fun with this.  Hopefully, someone else can
find this work useful and/or interesting.  Mostly the latter I suspect.

The program accepts a GML script on standard input and writes zero or more
PPM files as instructed by the source with the `render' command.

	* src/op.cc: Per kloepper, ofstream constructor needs ios::binary
	  flag on Windows and DOS, but otherwise works under Mingw32!

Wednesday, September 13, 2000  Jay 'Eraserhead' Felice <jfelice@cronosys.com>
	* Replaced string `CScalar::sval' with char *.  Saves 4 bytes per
	  scalar (since this is part of the union), as well as construction/
	  destruction call.
	* Implemented `CModel::do_csg_hits' and `CModel::enable_csg_hits' so
	  we can drop hits when we know we already have a closer one when
	  not doing CSG.
	* Hacked a lot of the models to not test for hits further than 
	  currently known hits.
	* Fixed some places where we exit(1) instead of assert on an error
	  (now throws an exception).
	* Catch exceptions in main() and display the error message.
	* Released 0.2!

Tuesday, September 12, 2000  Jay 'Eraserhead' Felice <jfelice@cronosys.com>
	* Deleted CScalar::aval member (not used).
	* Implemented CGmlError exception-derived class.  Replaced many 
	  asserts.
	* Fixed sphere hit test to reject reflections hitting self (when not
	  a shadow hit).
	* Added `sort' to CHit object as second key for sorting so we can
	  keep enter and exit hits which are at the same distance in the
	  proper order.
	* Added `macros.hh' files and now (conditionally) use g++ named
	  return value extension to avoid some constructor calls.

Monday, September 11, 2000  Jay 'Eraserhead' Felice <jfelice@cronosys.com>
	* Implemented spotlights.
	* Fixed issue with using always-zero intersection () value for
	  pointlight calculations.

Monday, September 11, 2000  Jay 'Eraserhead' Felice <jfelice@cronosys.com>
	* Fix issues with cylinder and cone.  (cone is still a little funky,
	  still investigating).
	* Released 0.1!

Sunday, September 10, 2000  Jay 'Eraserhead' Felice <jfelice@cronosys.com>
	* Add `intersect' operator.
	* Fix issues with distance of hit not scaled to local coordinates when
	  testing shadow hits.

Saturday, September 9, 2000  Jay 'Eraserhead' Felice <jfelice@cronosys.com>
	* Restructure CHitInfo to accept multiple hits, add all hits to
	  info structure in CModel, add CSG support.
	* Add `difference' operator.

Thursday, September 7, 2000  Jay 'Eraserhead' Felice <jfelice@cronosys.com>
	* Implement cylinder and cone primitives.

Wednesday, September 6, 2000  Jay 'Eraserhead' Felice <jfelice@cronosys.com>
	* Heap now pre-allocates slots to avoid problems with certain -lstdc++
	* Rewrote (again) heap/gc for *big* performance gain.

Tuesday, September 5, 2000  Jay 'Eraserhead' Felice <jfelice@cronosys.com>
	* Found new source of information about calculating matrix inverses,
	  implemented (corrected some issues).
	* Implemented `cube' primitive.
	* Begin implementing `cylinder' primitive.

Monday, September 4, 2000  Jay 'Eraserhead' Felice <jfelice@cronosys.com>
	* Implemented point lights.

Saturday, September 2, 2000  Jay 'Eraserhead' Felice <jfelice@cronosys.com>
	* Rewrote gc to have more modular types.

Wednesday, August 30, 2000  Jay 'Eraserhead' Felice <jfelice@cronosys.com>
	* Packaged up with automake/autoconf, tagged version 0.1.
